# AI usage
im using gemini ai to explain the task with the explanation of the algorithm in the different "chat"

Here's the list of queries I used

1. i have a project on making something with c++, for the context i'm using qt6 to do this task, i want to create an application with a canvas, with convex hull algorithm implemented. for the inputs, the user able to draw or put many vertexes in the canvas

2. The program "BuildConsole.exe" does not exist or is not executable. why is it happening

3. Explain how the code works

4. Do I need a main.moc file? 

5. How do you make it into separated files?

6. how do i make my code to run with a click not just running simultaneously

7. My clear button doesnt work, how do i fix it

# Collaboration usage
big thanks to Deric Navino because he helped me when building the code doesnt work properly, so i spent 3 hour just to fix my compiling error on the qt, and asked why do i need header file since its been so long since the last time i implmented code on c++, thus i forgot so many things on learning about cpp, like why do i need different file for window and canvas, also i asked deric why can't i just make it into a single file contained everything it needs.
